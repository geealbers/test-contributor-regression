Upon his return to New York, he published his first images in 1930. During the Great Depression, Evans began to photograph for the Resettlement Administration, later known as the Farm aecurity Administration (FSA), documenting workers and architecture in the Southeastern states. In 1936 he traveled with the writer James Agee to illustrate an article on tenant farm families for <em>Fortune</em> magazine; the book <em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em> came out of this collaboration.</p>\n<p>Throughout his career Evans contributed photographs to numerous publications, including three devoted solely to his work. In 1965 he left Fortune, where he had been a staff photographer for twenty years, to become a professor of photography and graphic design at Yale University.

While considering a position with the RA in the spring of 1935, he jotted down those things he would require of his employer, including the “guarantee of one-man performance,” and what he would provide, adding that he should not be asked to do anything more in the way of political propaganda: “[I] Mean never [to] make photographic statements for the government or do photographic chores for gov or anyone in gov, no matter how powerful—this is pure record not propaganda. The value and, if you like, even the propaganda value for the government lies in the record itself which in the long run will prove an intelligent and farsighted thing to have done.

Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<h2>Documenting American Life</h2>\n<p>Because his pictures had been issued by the agency with policy-approved captions for the past three years, Evans felt the need in 1938 to distance himself from that establishment, as well as the world of commercial publishing, by prefacing <em>American Photographs</em> with this statement: “The responsibility for the selection of the pictures used in this book has rested with the author, and the choice has been determined by his opinion: therefore they are presented without sponsorship or connection with the policies, aesthetic or political, of any of the institutions, publications or government agencies for which some of the work has been done.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> Stryker’s business was to provide informative images to the mass media, and he and Evans would always disagree about the most appropriate vehicle for the latter’s photographs, as well as the definition of “documentary.” But when the photography project of the RA began, the two men were able to agree on its primary subject: American history as exemplified by life in the average American town. Evans’s vision for documenting American life had begun to form much earlier; a letter drafted to his friend Ernestine Evans, an editor at J. B. Lippincott, in February of 1934, makes clear his aspirations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What do I want to do? … I know now is the time for picture books. An American city is the best, Pittsburgh better than Washington. I know more about such a place. I would want to visit several besides Pittsburgh before deciding. Something perhaps smaller. Toledo, Ohio, maybe. Then I’m not sure a book of photos should be identified locally. American city is what I’m after… People, all classes, surrounded by bunches of the new down-and-out. Automobiles and the automobile landscape. Architecture, American urban taste, commerce, small scale, large scale, the city street atmosphere, the street smell, the hateful stuff, women’s clubs, fake culture, bad education, religion in decay…<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The two men could find common ground in part due to the widespread influence of the 1929 publication <em>Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture</em> by Robert and Helen Lynd, professors of sociology at Columbia and Sarah Lawrence, respectively. A 550-page field investigation by social anthropologists with subject headings including “What Middletown does to get its living” and “The houses in which Middletown lives,” this pioneering project attempted an objective analysis of life in a small Midwestern American city (Muncie, Indiana). The Lynds’ study was hailed as a very accessible report that was most appealing because it made “no attempt to prove anything” but simply recorded “what was observed.” The Lynds introduced their topic by saying their goal “was to study synchronously the interwoven trends that are the life of a small American city. A typical city, strictly speaking, does not exist, but the city studied was selected a shaving many features in common to a wide group of communities.” (<cite class=\"quire-citation expandable\"><span class=\"quire-citation__button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-expanded=\"false\">Lynd 1929, 3</span><span class=\"quire-citation__content\" hidden>Lynd, Robert S., and Helen Merrell Lynd. <em>Middletown: A Study in American Culture</em> San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1929; reprint, Harvest/HBJ, 1956.</span></cite>)</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-1\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A man, from the chest up, in a decorated uniform turned to look at the camera.

The result was a “shooting script” for “things which should be photographed as American Background,” issued by Stryker to his team of photographers. The script contains an extensive listing of items like “People on and off the job,” “How do people look?,” “The wall decoration in homes as an index to the different income groups and their reactions,” and “A photographic study of use of leisure time in various income groups.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<details class=\"accordion-section\" id=\"section-on-assignment-accordion\" open > <summary class=\"accordion-section__heading accordion-section__heading-level-2 accordion-section__controls accordion-section__controls--arrow\" tabindex=\"1\"> <button aria-label=\"Copy page section link to clipboard\" class=\"accordion-section__copy-link-button\" data-outputs-exclude=\"pdf,epub\" value=\"#section-on-assignment\" tabindex=\"2\" > § </button> <span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"accordion-tooltip\" data-outputs-exclude=\"pdf,epub\" > Copied page section link to clipboard </span> <h2>On Assignment</h2> </summary> <section class=\"accordion-section__body\"><figure id=\"fig-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-left\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A large stone cross in the foreground, with smaller grave markers receding behind.

Between November 1935 and April 1936, Evans made two lengthy road trips that would account for the bulk of his entire production for the RA and many of the 169 mid-thirties pictures that follow this essay. From November to mid-January, here turned to industrial centers in Pennsylvania, finally spending some time in Pittsburgh, and went on to Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, following to some extent the course outlined in the memorandum above. In February 1936, he left again, with a completely Southern itinerary that would take him through many small cities, some of them renowned for ante-bellum architecture and Civil War battles, in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, and Virginia.</p> <p>In the spring of 1936, Stryker approved a furlough for Evans to work on a <em>Fortune</em> story with James Agee. This leave for mid-July through mid-September allowed Evans to return to the “middle south” with Agee to prepare “an article on cotton tenantry in the United States, in the form of a photographic and verbal record of the daily lives and environment of an average white family of tenant farmers” (<a href=\"#fig-4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig-5\">Figure 5</a>).

An unusual and demanding assignment for Evans, this trip of late January and February 1937 was made with another RA photographer, Edwin Locke, and required that he spend considerable time in the affected area, photographing the flood victims and their temporary shelters.</p> </section> </details>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This would be his last travel for the RA, an agency that was absorbed into the Farm Security Administration at about this time. Evans’s contributions to the RA’s documentation of Depression-era America had essentially been obtained between the summer of 1935 and the spring of 1936, a period of less than a year. The Alabama pictures made while on leave to <em>Fortune</em> would become his best-known photographs and, ironically, those most closely identified with his work as a New Deal photographer.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Memorandum draft by Walker Evans, reproduced in <em>Walker Evans at Work</em>, (New York: Harper and Row, 1982), 112. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Walker Evans to Ernestine Evans, unfinished two-page letter in black ink on hotel stationery, dated Feb. 1934, first published in <em>Walker Evans at Work</em>, 98.

It was also featured as a full-page reproduction in September 1936 issue of <em>Survey Graphic</em>, titled “Draggin’-Around People” and captioned “A blighted pea crop in California in 1935 left the pickers without work. This family sold their tent to get food.” Also in this issue was an article by Taylor entitled “From the Group Up.” His report on demonstration projects of the New Deal’s Resettlement Administration in Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, and California was illustrated with four more picture by Lange.</p>\n<p>Since it was first published, this composition, best known as <em>Migrant Mother</em>, has come to represent not only the pictorial archive created by the RA/FSA during the 1930s but also the Great Depression itself. Posters and other publicity of later activists fighting racial, economic, and political oppression have borrowed from Lange’s icon of the time. The <a class=\"ref\" data-annotation-ids=\"\" data-figure-id=\"cat-1\" data-region=\"1260,400,2177,2488\" data-sequence-index=\"null\" data-sequence-transition=\"30\" >handsome, androgynous face</a>, the pose of stoic anxiety, and the encumbrance of <a class=\"ref\" data-annotation-ids=\"\" data-figure-id=\"cat-1\" data-region=\"3020,320,1717,2855\" data-sequence-index=\"null\" data-sequence-transition=\"30\" >three</a> <a class=\"ref\" data-annotation-ids=\"\" data-figure-id=\"cat-1\" data-region=\"120,1350,1706,1806\" data-sequence-index=\"null\" data-sequence-transition=\"30\" >young</a> <a class=\"ref\" data-annotation-ids=\"\" data-figure-id=\"cat-1\" data-region=\"3150,3780,1540,1245\" data-sequence-index=\"null\" data-sequence-transition=\"30\" >children</a> proved to be universal attributes. With Lange’s artistry, Owens took on the timeless quality of Eugéne Delacroix’s strong female rebel (<em>Liberty Leading the People</em>), Jean-François Millet’s peasant woman (the agrarian ideal), Honoré Daumier’s laundresses (the working woman) and Käthe Kollwitz’s proletarian woman warrior (one of the mothers leading her <em>Peasants’ War</em>).</p>\n<p>Owens, although she became famous, did not enjoy, even momentarily, the life of a celebrity. She had three more children and kept moving with her family, following the California crops. She did become involved in efforts to organize farm labor and would sometimes serve as the straw boss, one who negotiates wages for migrants as the picking season begins. She was still working in the fields at age fifty before finally marrying again (to George Thompson) and settling into a stable life in Modesto, California.</p>\n<p>Several Lange images from the same photoshoot with Owens and her children exist <a href=\"https://guides.loc.gov/migrant-mother/introduction\" target=\"_blank\">in other collections</a>. These give us the chance to consider the  many varied choices in composition that Lange made in producing her iconic final image.</p>\n<figure id=\"mother-variants\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-variants\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><canvas-panel canvas-id=\"http://test-contributor-regression.geealbers.net/iiif/mother-variants/canvas\" choice-id=\"\" height=\"\" iiif-content=\"\" manifest-id=\"http://test-contributor-regression.geealbers.net/iiif/mother-variants/manifest.json\" preset=\"responsive\" region=\"0,0,1012,1012\" virtual-sizes=\"\" width=\"\"> </canvas-panel></a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-variants\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1.1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Alternate versions of Dorothea Lange’s <em>Migrant Mother</em>, 1936.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division</span> </figcaption> <form data-outputs-include=\"html\"><fieldset class=\"annotations-ui\">   <legend></legend>   <div class=\"annotations-ui__input-wrapper\" id=\"lightbox-mother-variants-0-lange-mother-b\">     <input class=\"annotations-ui__input\" id=\"lightbox-mother-variants-0-lange-mother-b-input\" name=\"lightbox-mother-variants-0\" type=\"radio\" value=\"http://test-contributor-regression.geealbers.net/iiif/mother-variants/lange-mother-b.jpg\" data-annotation-id=\"lange-mother-b\" data-annotation-type=\"choice\" checked=\"\">     <label class=\"annotations-ui__label\" for=\"lightbox-mother-variants-0-lange-mother-b-input\">       Variant #1     </label>   </div>    <div class=\"annotations-ui__input-wrapper\" id=\"lightbox-mother-variants-0-lange-mother-c\">     <input class=\"annotations-ui__input\" id=\"lightbox-mother-variants-0-lange-mother-c-input\" name=\"lightbox-mother-variants-0\" type=\"radio\" value=\"http://test-contributor-regression.geealbers.net/iiif/mother-variants/lange-mother-c.jpg\" data-annotation-id=\"lange-mother-c\" data-annotation-type=\"choice\">     <label class=\"annotations-ui__label\" for=\"lightbox-mother-variants-0-lange-mother-c-input\">       Variant #2     </label>   </div>  </fieldset> </form> </figure>\n<figure id=\"mother-annotations\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-annotations\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><canvas-panel canvas-id=\"http://test-contributor-regression.geealbers.net/iiif/mother-annotations/canvas\" choice-id=\"\" height=\"\" iiif-content=\"\" manifest-id=\"http://test-contributor-regression.geealbers.net/iiif/mother-annotations/manifest.json\" preset=\"responsive\" region=\"0,0,1200,1455\" virtual-sizes=\"\" width=\"\"> </canvas-panel></a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#mother-annotations\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1.2</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">This version of the print from the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division is mounted on paper board and includes an original FSA label.
